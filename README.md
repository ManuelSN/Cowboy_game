# Cowboy Game :cowboy_hat_face:

This is a Cowboy Game developed in Processing. There are two ways to shoot, with the mouse or with a piezoelectric sensor. The piezoelectric pulses are detected by the analogue input of the Arduino, processed and sent via the serial port to the main processing program.

You will find a demo video of the game [here](https://github.com/ManuelSN/Cowboy_game/tree/main/data/video).

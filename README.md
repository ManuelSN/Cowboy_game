# Cowboy Game :cowboy_hat_face:

This is a Cowboy Game developed in Processing. There are two ways to shoot, with the mouse or with a piezoelectric sensor. The piezoelectric pulses are detected by the analogue input of the Arduino, processed and sent via the serial port to the main processing program.
